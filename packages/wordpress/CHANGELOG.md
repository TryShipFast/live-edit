# ShipFast Live Edit for WordPress

## 0.15.34

The site icon picker previews light and dark SVGs against a split light and dark surface, keeping fixed-color marks visible while choosing.

## 0.15.31

The Laravel fallback now reads and mutates only its own installation drafts. Drafts belonging to registered API sites stay private to their site, including when an edit is reverted, published or discarded.

## 0.15.25

Licence status is now checked against the hostname serving the current request.
Its cached answer and outage grace are scoped to that hostname, so a valid
answer for the canonical domain cannot turn editing on for an unlisted
subdomain served by the same WordPress installation.

## 0.15.13

The shared editor runtime now waits for the page's editor marker before
starting, so the toolbar is not lost to a timing race. Invited editors also no
longer get editing controls for regions the developer locked; the API
continues to enforce the same restriction when a save is submitted.

## 0.11.0

The first release since plans were enforced, so most of this is a customer
being told things they were not told before.

**A lapsed licence now says renew.** It said "Invalid or missing API key",
which is the one message guaranteed to send somebody hunting through their
dashboard for a key that was never the problem. A refused save said "Sorry,
you are not allowed to do that". Both now say what happened, and the save
refusal comes back as 402 rather than 401: this is not "you may not", it is
"this needs paying for".

**Page limits.** A plan can cover fewer pages than the site has. Over the
allowance the page is served exactly as a visitor sees it, published words and
all, with a dismissable strip saying why the editor is not there and where to
go. Nothing about the website itself changes, here or anywhere else.

**Every page is its own page.** Without pretty permalinks WordPress calls them
all "/", and the plugin took that at face value, so every page of such a site
shared one set of keys: editing About wrote over the home page. Sites with
permalinks switched on are unaffected and nothing is re-tagged for them.

**The service address is filled in.** It was an empty box every customer typed
by hand, and a URL typed by hand is a URL with a typo in it.

### Upgrading

Replace the plugin folder, or upload the zip through Plugins → Add New →
Upload. Settings are untouched.

Built with `bin/build-wordpress-plugin`, which takes the version from the
plugin header so the file cannot claim to be something the code is not.
